Lianliankan (连连看), also known as Link Link or Matching Game. It's a popular tile-matching puzzle game originating from China. The main objective of the game is to remove all the tiles from the board by linking pairs of identical tiles. The tiles can only be linked if the path between them has no more than three straight lines, and no other tiles are blocking the way.
